## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Formatting

> In the document options, eval: false and echo: false mean that the entire document will not evaluate or print code (just shows text).
>
> Other formatting options can be found here: <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html>

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

-   The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Other valuable chunk options

-   `#| eval: false`: Don’t evaluate this chunk! Really helpful if you’re trying to isolate an error, or have a chunk that takes a long time

-   `#| error: true`: Render this *even if* the chunk causes an error

-   `#| cache: true`: Store the results of this chunk so that it doesn’t need to re-run every time, as long as there are no changes

-   `#| warning: false`: Don’t print warnings

-   `#| message: false`: Don’t print messages

-   `#| label: Label Name Here`: give a section a label
